# About Apicize

[Apicize](https://github.com/apicize/app) is a cross-platform (Linux, Windows, MacOS) HTML testing tool
that emphasizes testability and security. It is currently under development, but is functional and suitable for
evaluation and testing. You can download the app from <a href="https://github.com/apicize/app/releases/latest/"
target="_blank">here</a>.

Workbooks created in the UI can be executed via a CI/CD-friendly [CLI runner](https://github.com/apicize/cli). 
This allows developers to easily create and use tests interactively, and those tests can later be executed 
in build and/or deplyment pipelines without modification.
